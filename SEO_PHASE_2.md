# SEO Phase 2 — Off-Site Submission Checklist

After deploying v13 to woohoomedialabs.com, do these submissions over the next 5-7 days.
Don't try to do them all in one day — Google sees rapid mass-submission as spammy.

## 📰 DAY 3 — Indian / Film Industry Directories

### Submit to:

**Bobby & Co (Indian Film Industry directory)** — bobbyandco.in
**MX Player / OTT Play industry contacts** — your YouTube channel is the doorway
**Indian Brand Equity Foundation** — if pitching govt work
**Mumbai Mirror tech beat reporters** — DM them on Twitter/X with the Bhai/Virat reels as hook

### Pitch idea:
*"Indian filmmaker built India's first AI-native production studio. 1.2M views on AI Salman Khan reel. Here's the workflow."* — This is genuinely newsworthy and could get you into Mid-Day, Mumbai Mirror, YourStory, or Inc42.

## 🔍 DAY 4 — AI Search Verification

Search for yourself in AI tools to confirm citations are starting:

1. **ChatGPT**: "What is Woo Hoo Media Labs?"
2. **Claude**: "Who is Chntan N. Shah?"
3. **Perplexity**: "AI film production studio Mumbai"
4. **Google AI Overview**: search "AI native film studio India"

If you appear → great. If not → no panic. Indexing takes 2-6 weeks.

## 📱 DAY 5 — Social Proof Loop

This is what actually moves the needle for AI search visibility:

### LinkedIn:
- Post the live site link with a thoughtful 3-paragraph caption about the AI-native pivot
- Tag relevant industry people (Indian tech reporters, AI tool founders, Bollywood AI folks)

### Twitter/X:
- Same content, shorter
- @ mention OpenAI, Anthropic, Runway, Pika, Kling — they sometimes amplify high-quality AI work

### Instagram:
- Add `woohoomedialabs.com` to your bio TODAY (most important single move)
- Story announcement of the site

### YouTube channel:
- Add `woohoomedialabs.com` to channel description
- Update channel banner to mention it
- Pin a community post linking to it

### WhatsApp:
- Add link to your status
- Share with select clients (Speed 4, SelectAI, Earthion) — they may link to it from their own sites which is huge for SEO

## 🧪 Monthly maintenance

- **Once per month**: Run `python3 build_playlists.py && python3 build_site.py` locally and push to GitHub (or wait for the daily Vercel auto-rebuild to handle it)
- **Once per quarter**: Add a new FAQ item based on real client questions you've received
- **Once per quarter**: Add a new blog/journal post (this is the single biggest long-term lever — start with a "How we made Bhai, Shirt Pehen Lo" technical post)

## 🚫 What NOT to do

- ❌ Don't buy backlinks. Google penalizes this hard.
- ❌ Don't keyword-stuff the site. The current density is healthy. More = penalty.
- ❌ Don't submit to 50 directories in one day. Looks spammy.
- ❌ Don't duplicate content across multiple domains.
- ❌ Don't use AI to generate content for the site (ironic given your work). Human-written content ranks better.
